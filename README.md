# Gameover

> Play text-based games right in your terminal.

Gameover is a platform for distributing text-based games for the terminal. It consists of a web-based directory of games and a program for installing and playing them.

## Features

1. Search for and install games
2. Compete with friends through shared leaderboards and multiplayer games
3. Easily publish games without worrying about compiling and distributing binaries

## Develop a game

Games are written in Go. I recommend using the [Charm](https://charm.sh) libraries. To make your game installable through Gameover, just send a PR adding your game to `games.yml`.
